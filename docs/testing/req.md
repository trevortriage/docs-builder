# Requirements

To follow this tutorial you will need to install the following components:

- An installation of Elasticsearch, based on our hosted [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud) service (which includes a free trial period), or a self-hosted service that you run on your own computer. See the Install Elasticsearch section above for installation instructions.
- A [Python](https://python.org) interpreter. Make sure it is a recent version, such as Python 3.8 or newer.

The tutorial assumes that you have no previous knowledge of Elasticsearch or general search topics, but it expects you to have a basic familiarity with the following technologies, at least at a beginner level:

- Python development
- The [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web framework for Python.
- The command prompt or terminal application in your operating system.
