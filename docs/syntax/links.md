# Links

A markdown link looks like this:

```markdown
[Link text](destination.md)
```
It has two components:
- Link **text** enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`
- Link **destination** enclosed in parentheses `( )`

## Link types

### Internal links

Link between documentation files using either relative or absolute paths.

#### Relative paths
Navigate relative to the current file's location:

```markdown
[Security documentation](../security/index.md)

[Monitoring guide](monitor/index.md)
```

#### Absolute paths

You can also use absolute paths to link to pages within the same repository.
Say you're working on a random page somewhere in the `docs-content` repo. You can link to a page in the `deploy-manage` section like this:

```markdown
[API Keys](/deploy-manage/api-keys.md)
```

Note the leading `/` before the path.

### Same-page links (anchors)

Link to sections within the same document using heading anchors prefixed with `#`:

```markdown
[Jump to the next section](#next-section-anchor)
```

Headings will automatically create anchor links in the resulting HTML. They are automatically generated by:

- Converting to lowercase
- Replacing spaces with hyphens
- Removing special characters

For example:

```markdown
### Same-page links (anchors)
<!-- Creates anchor #same-page-links-anchors -->
```

#### Custom anchors
You can specify custom anchors for headings inline:

```markdown
## License management [manage-license]
<!-- Creates anchor #manage-license instead of #license-management -->
```

Custom anchors are also cleaned up to remove special characters and spaces, and converted to lowercase:

```markdown
## API Setup [First Time Setup!]
<!-- Creates anchor #first-time-setup -->
```

### Cross-repository links

Link to documentation in different repositories using the `scheme://path` syntax:

```markdown
[Kibana API documentation](kibana://api/index.md)
[Beats configuration](beats://configuration.md)
```

The syntax follows the format `<scheme>://<path>`, where:
- `scheme`: The target repository name (e.g., kibana, beats)
- `path`: The file path within that repository

### External links

Link to websites and resources outside the Elastic docs:

```markdown
[Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co)
[Elastic Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide)
```

## Link formatting

### Style link text

You can include Markdown formatting within link text:

```markdown
[**Distributed architecture**](distributed-architecture.md)

[*Production guidance* and best practices](production-guidance.md)

[`manage-connectors.md`](manage-connectors.md)
```

### Auto-generated link text

When linking to local Markdown files, you can omit the link text to automatically use the target page's title:

```markdown
[](maintenance.md)  
<!-- Uses the title from maintenance.md -->

[](monitoring.md#alerting)
<!-- Uses "Alerting" section title from monitoring.md -->
```

You can also auto-generate text for specific headings within files:

```markdown
[](deploy.md#scaling)
<!-- Uses "Scaling" section title from deploy.md -->

[](#configuration)  
<!-- Uses the "Configuration" section title from current file -->
```

## Legacy features

### Inline anchors

::::{warning}
This syntax exists to aid with migration. It is scheduled for removal and **should not be used** in new content.

```markdown
Some text $$$custom-anchor$$$ more text
```
