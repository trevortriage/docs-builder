# These are developer notes

Because this page is included as hidden:


```yaml
toc:
  - file: index.md
  - hidden: developer-notes.md
```

This page 

- will not appear in the TOC navigation
- will always include a `noindexed` meta header.


This page **can** be linked to using [a regular link](developer-notes.md)
