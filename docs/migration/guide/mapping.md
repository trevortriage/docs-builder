# What books were migrated?

We did not migrate all Elastic documentation. We are purposefully leaving the majority of content behind in the legacy Asciidoc build system. This system will turn into our documentation archive.

A full list of the content that was migrated to the V3 format is available [here](https://github.com/elastic/asciidocalypse/blob/main/docs/readme.md).
