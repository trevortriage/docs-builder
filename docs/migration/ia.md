# Improved information architecture

The improved information architecture fundamentally transforms how we organize and present Elastic Docs. By addressing longstanding challenges—such as fragmented content across many books and duplicated information—this new structure introduces a cohesive framework that emphasizes clarity, usability, and alignment with user goals. These updates are designed to create a seamless experience for both readers and contributors, fostering greater understanding of our products and their benefits.

The new IA design does the following:

* Provides a clear narrative pathway for users to follow, including new topics that compare similar technologies and features.
* Organizes content by user goal and role.
* Consolidates content previously duplicated across our books, including cloud hosted, serverless, and stack content, and many tasks that are common across deployment types and solutions.
* Explains the context a topic applies to (deployment type, version). Check out [Consolidated versioning](versioning.md) for more information.
* Separates reference content into its own section for easy access.
