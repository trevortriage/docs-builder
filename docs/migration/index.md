# Migration to docs-builder

:::{important}
We are enforcing a [Documentation Freeze](./freeze/index.md) while we migrate docs between our two build systems.
:::

Migrating to Elastic Docs V3 is more than just moving to a new documentation build system. This migration includes:

* [New syntax](./syntax.md): from AsciiDoc to Markdown
* [New information architecture (IA)](./ia.md): aligning docs around user goals, not internal org structure
* [New versioning](./versioning.md): consolidation from many to one
* [New reference guidelines](./engineering.md): Engineering ownership of reference documentation & New API guidelines

View the [migration guide](./guide/index.md) to learn more about migration tooling, what content sets are migrating, how to migrate content, and more.
