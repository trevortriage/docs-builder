# Elastic Docs contribution guide

Welcome, **contributor**!

Whether you're a technical writer or you've only edited Elastic docs once or twice, you're a valued contributor. Every word matters!

## Contribute to the docs [#contribute]

The version of the docs you want to contribute to determines the tool and syntax you must use to update the docs.

### Contribute to Elastic Stack version 8.x docs and earlier

To contribute to earlier versions of the Elastic Stack, you must work with our [legacy documentation build system](https://github.com/elastic/docs). This system uses AsciiDoc as it's authoring format.

* For **simple bugfixes and enhancements** --> [Contribute on the web](on-the-web.md)
* For **complex or multi-page updates** --> See the [legacy documentation build guide](https://github.com/elastic/docs?tab=readme-ov-file#building-documentation)

### Contribute to Elastic Stack version 9.0 docs and later

* For **simple bugfixes and enhancements** --> [contribute on the web](on-the-web.md)
* For **complex or multi-page updates** --> [Contribute locally](locally.md)

## Report a bug

* It's a **documentation** problem --> [Open a docs issue](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content/issues/new?template=internal-request.yaml) *or* [Fix it myself](locally.md)
* It's a **build tool (docs-builder)** problem --> [Open a bug report](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/issues/new?template=bug-report.yaml)

## Request an enhancement

* Make the **documentation** better --> [Open a docs issue](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content/issues/new?template=internal-request.yaml)
* Make our **build tool (docs-builder)** better --> [Start a docs-builder discussion](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/discussions)

## Work on docs-builder

That sounds great! See [development](../development/index.md) to learn how to contribute to our documentation build system.
