This section will help you understand how to update and contribute to our documentation post-migration.

## **Updating Documentation**

Depending on the version that your update impacts you may need to take different steps.

### **Update content for Version 8.x and earlier** [update-content-for-version-8.x-and-earlier]

For content that is related to 8.x, these changes should be done in the original source folders in their respective repositories. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the page that is impacted  
2. Click the **edit** button  
3. Ensure the targeted branch is \<insert proper branch\>  
4. Make the necessary updates.  
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request.  
6. Add the appropriate labels per repo as found at [Page: Working across docs repos](https://elasticco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/61604182/Working+across+docs+repos)

Note: If you are working in a repo like Kibana or the cloud repo where backports can be complicated. You can use the [backport tool](https://github.com/sorenlouv/backport) to manage your backport.

### **Update content for Version 9.0 and later** [update-content-for-version-9.0-and-later]

For content related to version 9.0 and future versions, updates should be made in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content)  repository. Follow these steps to ensure your contributions are correctly made:

1. Navigate to the page that is impacted  
2. Click the **Edit** button.  
3. Identify the section that requires updates.  
4. Make the necessary updates.  
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request.


## **What if I need to update both 8.x and 9.x docs?**

If you need to merge changes that relate to version 8.x to the 9.0 and later documentation it is recommended to update the 9.x documentation first in markdown. Then you can convert the updates to asciidoc and make the changes to the 8.x documentation. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to convert your markdown file to asciidoc  
2. Update the content 9.x first in markdown as described in [Version 9.0 and Later](#update-content-for-version-9.0-and-later) in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository  
3. Run your changes through pandoc  
   1. If you need to bring over the entire file you can run the following command and it will create an asciidoc file for you. `pandoc -f gfm -t asciidoc ./<file-name>.md -o <file-name>.asciidoc`  
   2. If you just need to port a specific section you can use: `pandoc -f gfm -t asciidoc ./<file-name>.md` and the output of the file will be in your command window from which you can copy.  
4. Follow the steps in [Update content for Version 8.x and earlier](#update-content-for-version-8.x-and-earlier) to publish your changes.   
5. If the change is too large or complicated, create a new issue in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository detailing the changes made for the team to triage.  
6. Merge the changes and close the issue once the updates are reflected in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository.

## **Migration Considerations**

During the migration, content may be moved around, and there won't be a 1-to-1 mapping between old and new locations. This means updates may need to be applied in multiple places. If your changes affect version 8.x content, consider merging those changes in the 9.x content first and then add it to the appropriate 8.x content. If you have any issues create an issue in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository. 

% To be added “Kibana and Cloud repository instructions. You need to target main to backport. Changes in main will be lost and you need to recreate it in the new architecture after the freeze is over.

% Need a good category mapping across the content .. not to the file level for area level
