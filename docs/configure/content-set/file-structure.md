# File structure

The file structure of each content set directly impacts the url path structure of each page. In other words, the directory structure you pull into docs-builder is the same as the directory structure it spits out.

## Navigation

Navigation is set independent of directory and file structure in docset and toc files.

See [Navigation](./navigation.md) to learn more.
