# Redirects

## From an elastic.co/guide page

The web team owns redirects for `elastic.co`. Writers do not have direct access to the system where www.elastic.co redirects are managed.

### Permanent redirect

Currently the only way to implement true redirects from a page on `elastic.co/guide` is to open an issue with the web team, add your request to a Google Sheet, and wait for the web team to address your request.

### Stopgap

Writers have developed a stopgap to communicate to users that content has been removed or moved to another location. We create a page at the existing URL that links to the new location of the information. This is better than removing a page without redirecting at all, but is not the best user experience and doesn't align with SEO best practices.

## From an elastic.co/docs page

STRATEGY TBD

## Migration redirects

* Docs inventory script: https://github.com/elastic/docs-helpers/tree/main/docs-inventory
* Docs inventory sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LfPI3TZqdpONGxOmL8B8V-Feo1flLwObz9_ibCEMkIQ/edit?gid=605983744#gid=605983744

This sheet will be used to request redirects after migration from 8.current to 9.current.
